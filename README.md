# SimpleBank
Simple project scheme where it is possible to register users with a respective value and carry out a transfer between them.
Project made following the tutorial in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXunBiLq2SM&t=3928s
In the project itself, Java Spring was used, I opted for phoenix to improve my knowledge in the same.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * start the postgres container with docker compose up -d or use any postgress database of your choice
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
